# JS

## console.log

Like a function `print`

## const, let, var

`const` can't be changed, `let` can be change, also you can use `var`, but nowadays we don't. Cuz we can't check it would be changed or not, if use var.

## true or false, null, undefined

`true` means 1 , `false` means 0 and `null` means variable has nothing. `undefined` create memory of variable in computer, but variable has nothing and undefined "value"
